I discussed the exercise with: -

=============================
=  README for ex8- Asteroids game
=============================

usage:

python3 asteroidsMain.py <num_asteroids> 




==================
=  Description:  =
==================

in this exercise we did the asteroids game using classes.
in each func we called to the other builttin funcs in the needed classes, with 
them we built each part of the game. 
the API was helping a lot, for each part i needed to do in the funcs i went to 
look up in the API to see which func i should call and what it does.

i did the 2nd bonus:

for that i looked online to see how it works. 
in order to add one argument to the usage line, we need to use the sis modoule.
in it we need to use the sis.argv which let us add arguments to the usage line.
if there were added argumnets, it sends it to the main, in there it sends it
to the gamerunner which run the game. then it changes the amount of the
asteroids consider the input number.

i didnt know if i should put my strings of the messages and titles into 
constant. i thought that it doesnt change through the game and i dont want 
someone else to chanch the strings. its not clear whether it considers has 
"magic strings" or not. if you can make it clear i will appreciate it.
